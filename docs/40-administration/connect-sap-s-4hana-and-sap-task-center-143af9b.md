# Connect SAP S/4HANA and SAP Task Center

Find information about the destination configuration that needs to be done for SAP Task Center in order to work with on-premise tasks from SAP S/4HANA on SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment.



<a name="loio143af9bb452f4aa5a9980035d9edee5b__prereq_jrj_4f1_ckb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You have performed the steps in [Prepare SAP Cloud Connector and SAP S/4HANA for the SAP Task Center Connection](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/0f18dddf28764f5b807ecd80549044cc/5c6cf3d9e754468fbd6b3f5073fe085f.html?locale=en-US&version=latest). Choose your SAP S/4HANA version from the dropdown menu next to the documentation title.

    > ### Caution:  
    > For the setup of SAP Task Center, you must have a Cloud Connector that uses user UUID as the subject pattern for principal propagation. If you already have a Cloud Connector configuration that uses a different subject pattern \(for example, e-mail\), create a second Cloud Connector with user UUID and use it for the SAP Task Center communication.

    Make sure you save the following information, as you need it for the SAP S/4HANA destination setup:

    -   \(Optional\) *Location ID* from step *Perform the initial configuration of the Cloud Connector and define location ID*

        > ### Note:  
        > *Location ID* is a mandatory property for the creation of the destination only if you have more than one Cloud Connectors in the subaccount.

    -   *Virtual Host* and *Virtual Port* from step *Configure access control in the Cloud Connector for your SAP S/4HANA back-end system*


-   You have performed the steps in [SAP Task Center Integration](https://help.sap.com/viewer/0f18dddf28764f5b807ecd80549044cc/latest/en-US/1da230b82a984cda85d0041e13060a87.html) and have a user name and password for granting access to the task pull service, as described in [Create Service User for Task Pull Service](https://help.sap.com/viewer/0f18dddf28764f5b807ecd80549044cc/latest/en-US/229c5a1f659341efa2bb6205159d6209.html).

    Use the SAP Cloud Connector from the previous prerequisite for the step *Tunnel the request using, for example, the Cloud Connector* in [Configuring SAP Task Center Integration](https://help.sap.com/viewer/0f18dddf28764f5b807ecd80549044cc/latest/en-US/5117f21ef28f4e698d99fe3fdbc1be2a.html).

-   You have the client number of your SAP S/4HANA system.
-   You have completed all prerequisites listed in [Initial Setup](https://help.sap.com/docs/TASK_CENTER/08cbda59b4954e93abb2ec85f1db399d/834769400794464489f390350a82bbd6.html).


> ### Note:  
> Do not configure more than one destination to the same SAP S/4HANA system for one SAP Task Center. This will result in having duplicate tasks for end users.



## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the Cloud Foundry subaccount, where your SAP Task Center instance was created, and select the *Destinations* tab from the navigation area on the left.

2.  If you have executed the automatic setup \(see [Automatic Setup](../30-initial-setup/automatic-setup-3a49967.md)\), you already have a sample destination called *S4HANA*. You can use the sample destination or clone it, and update the properties as described below.

    If you have followed the manual setup \(see [Manual Setup](../30-initial-setup/manual-setup-0f00d3d.md)\), you have to create a new destination and manually add the properties as described below.

3.  Configure the properties of the destination as follows:


    <table>
    <tr>
    <th valign="top">

    Property


    
    </th>
    <th valign="top">

    Description


    
    </th>
    <th valign="top">

    Example or Value


    
    </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
        *Name*


    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
        Configure a destination name. It can be up to 16 characters long.

    > ### Note:  
    > The name of the destination must not be longer than 16 characters, otherwise the status of the respective SAP Task Center connector will be set to ***Error***.

    <td valign="top">
    
        Create the URL by following the pattern ***<Virtual Host\>:<Virtual Port\>***, using the values you've got when configuring the access control in the SAP Cloud Connector. For more information, see *Prerequisites*.

    > ### Note:  
    > If you change the *URL* of an already configured destination, for which there are stored tasks in the `Task Cache`, the tasks in it will be repopulated.

    > ### Caution:  
    > If you are using the sample destinations created by the booster \(see [Automatic Setup](../30-initial-setup/automatic-setup-3a49967.md)\), you must add the *tc.enabled* property manually. Without this property, the destination cannot be used by SAP Task Center.

    > ### Note:  
    > Any value other than ***true*** \(for example ***false***\) would have the following effects:
    > 
    > -   The previously stored tasks are kept in the task cache.
    > 
    > -   The tasks from this destination are **not** displayed in the SAP Task Center Web app.

    You can define a separate property for a filter tab translation for each of the supported languages \(see [Supported Languages](../10-what-is/supported-languages-c66c693.md)\), by appending the respective language code to the property.

    For example, add:

    -   the *tc.ui.group* property with the value ***<default\_translation\>*** for a default translation of the group name.

    -   the *tc.ui.group.de-DE* property with the value ***<German\_translation\>*** for a German translation of the group name.

4.  Save your configuration.

5.  \(Optional\) To check the connectivity between the SAP Task Center service and SAP S/4HANA, use the monitoring functionality of SAP Task Center. For more information, see [Monitoring](monitoring-9b30be7.md).

    If you choose *Check Connection* in the destination configuration, you may not receive correct information about the connectivity between the SAP Task Center service and SAP S/4HANA.
