# Destinations

The SAP Task Center communicates with the task provider applications via predefined destinations in a customer subaccount.

Not all of the listed properties in the destinations of your subaccounts are required. The optional and mandatory properties, needed for the setup of SAP Task Center, are listed in the tables of the following destination topics.

**SAP Task Center Service Destinations**

The service destinations are required for some SAP Task Center features.

> ### Note:  
> Do not set the *tc.enabled* property to these two service destinations.
