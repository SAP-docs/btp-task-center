# Destinations

SAP Task Center communicates with the task provider applications via predefined destinations in a customer subaccount.

There are two types of destinations, which you can create for SAP Task Center:

-   [SAP Task Center Service Destinations](sap-task-center-service-destinations-494aa0c.md) - The service destinations are required for some SAP Task Center features.

-   [Destinations to Task Providers](destinations-to-task-providers-b158111.md) - The communication between SAP Task Center and the task provider happens via these destinations.
