## Procedure

The SAP Concur entity may have Concur Expense, Concur Request, or both products. You have to create separate destinations for each product \(Concur Expense and Concur Request\). The *URL* specifies whether the destination is for Concur Expense or Concur Request. Each destination should have a unique combination of the fields *URL* and *Client Key*.

-   Create a destination for SAP Concur Expense, see [Connect SAP Concur Expense and SAP Task Center](connect-sap-concur-expense-and-sap-task-center-a087adb.md).

-   Create a destination for SAP Concur Request, see [Connect SAP Concur Request and SAP Task Center](connect-sap-concur-request-and-sap-task-center-65bd21c.md).
