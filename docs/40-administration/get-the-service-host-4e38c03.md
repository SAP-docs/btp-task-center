# Get the Service Host

The base URL of the SAP Task Center service is available from the `endpoints.inbox_rest_url` configuration parameter of the service key or of the service binding, depending on your application type.

For information about how to access this information, see [Get the Service Configuration Parameters](get-the-service-configuration-parameters-e10e7b2.md).

> ### Note:  
> If you access the Task Center API from a user interface of an application, you typically need to use a URL that enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing \(CORS\) through reverse proxies.
> 
> If, for example, you implement the Application Router instead of directly referring to this URL, you have to refer to application routes and destinations.
