## Prerequisites

> ### Tip:  
> ![](../30-initial-setup/images/28x28_launch_png_2484bce.png) See also the step-by-step mission for the setup of connection to SAP SuccessFactors at [Integrate Your SAP SuccessFactors Tasks Into SAP Task Center](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/missiondetail/3816/3869/).

-   You have completed the initial setup of SAP Task Center. For more information, see [Initial Setup](https://help.sap.com/docs/TASK_CENTER/08cbda59b4954e93abb2ec85f1db399d/834769400794464489f390350a82bbd6.html). Make sure you have followed the [SAP SuccessFactors Integration Scenario](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-identity/system-integration-guide/sap-successfactors-integration-scenario?version=Cloud).

-   You have executed the steps in [Enabling To-Do Task Integration Between SAP SuccessFactors and SAP Task Center](https://help.sap.com/viewer/568480cc877d4337992a2cd9792fbfed/latest/en-US/c15f23f6f4e24ddea84d5be8e6b935ae.html).


> ### Note:  
> Do not configure more than one primary destination to the same SAP SuccessFactors system for each SAP Task Center. This will result in having duplicate tasks for end users.



## Procedure

1.  In the SAP BTP cockpit, export your trust certificate:

    1.  Navigate to the Cloud Foundry subaccount, where your SAP Task Center instance was created, and select *Connectivity* \> *Destinations* from the navigation area on the left.

    2.  Choose *Download Trust*.
    3.  Save the trust certificate file locally.

    > ### Caution:  
    > Make sure to renew you trust certificate before it expires. For the time while you are renewing the trust certificate and updating it on the task provider systems you may not be able to work on tasks, nor receive task updates.
    > 
    > For more information, see [Renew Destination Trust Certificates](../60-security/credentials-rotation-8080abf.md#loio8080abf7d2cf4918802aa86e955ffc8b__section_RenewTrust).

2.  Create a primary destination with the technical user, as described in [Creating the Primary Destination with the Technical User](creating-the-primary-destination-with-the-technical-user-dc5407b.md).
