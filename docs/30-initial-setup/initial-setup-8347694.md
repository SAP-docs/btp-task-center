## Prerequisites

Before you can use the service, meet the following prerequisites and perform the initial setup.

-   You are entitled to create an instance of the SAP Task Center service and your global account uses the consumption-based commercial model.

    For more information, see [What Is the Consumption-Based Commercial Model?](https://help.sap.com/products/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/7047eb4a15a84ac7be3c8612179e6d1f.html).

-   Prepare your SAP Business Technology Platform \(SAP BTP\) account by making sure that:

    1.  You are a global account administrator.

        For more information, see [Getting a Global Account](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/d61c2819034b48e68145c45c36acba6e.html#loiod61c2819034b48e68145c45c36acba6e).

    2.  You have created a subaccount on Cloud Foundry in your global account.

        For more information, see [Relationship Between Global Accounts and Subaccounts](https://help.sap.com/viewer/3504ec5ef16548778610c7e89cc0eac3/Cloud/en-US/8ed4a705efa0431b910056c0acdbf377.html#loioeeda449cf252418a97e0f7c9abd30b9a) in [Account Model](https://help.sap.com/viewer/3504ec5ef16548778610c7e89cc0eac3/Cloud/en-US/8ed4a705efa0431b910056c0acdbf377.html).

    3.  You have created a space within a subaccount in which Cloud Foundry is enabled.

        For more information, see [Getting Started in the Cloud Foundry Environment](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/b328cc89ea14484d9655b8cfb8efb508.html).

    4.  Within that space, your user is assigned to the *Space Developer* role for the subaccount. For more information, see [About Roles in the Cloud Foundry Environment](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/about-roles-in-cloud-foundry-environment). You need this role to perform the configuration steps.

        For more information, see [Add Space Members Using the Cockpit](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/add-space-members-using-cockpit).

    5.  Establish trust with the User Account and Authentication \(UAA\) of your subaccount, using Identity Authentication.

        Identity Authentication is mandatory for working with SAP Task Center.

        For more information, see [Establish Trust and Federation Between UAA and Identity Authentication](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/161f8f0cfac64c4fa2d973bc5f08a894.html) or [Manually Establish Trust and Federation Between UAA and Identity Authentication](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/7c6aa87459764b179aeccadccd4f91f3.html).
