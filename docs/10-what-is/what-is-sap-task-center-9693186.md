# What Is SAP Task Center?

SAP Task Center helps you integrate tasks into a central solution. 

The SAP Task Center service enables integration with SAP and non-SAP applications to provide a single entry point for end users to access all their assigned tasks. The tasks can be accessed by end users through the SAP Task Center Web app, SAP Mobile Start app, and SAP Start.

You can use SAP Task Center as a unified inbox for tasks across multiple applications with integrated user experience. Tasks from multiple SAP solutions are gathered in one list and ready to be processed in just one click, shortening the completion time for business-critical tasks. For example, business users can process all their tasks from the connected systems, without the need to switch and log in separately into different inboxes.
