## What Is SAP Task Center Web App?

The SAP Task Center is a new unified inbox for approvals across multiple applications with a seamless and integrated user experience. Workflow tasks from multiple SAP solutions are gathered in one list by the SAP Task Center service and ready to be processed with just one click. In the Web app, you can view all workflow tasks that are assigned to you and process them. A workflow task is a type of workflow object that is visualized in the Web app.

You can use the Web app on a desktop or a mobile device. The app displays all the tasks that are assigned to you. The task list is organized in tabs. For more information, see [Working with Filter Tabs](working-with-filter-tabs-df0aec8.md).

> ### Note:  
> The header of the table and the icon tab bar have a sticky behavior. This allows you to scroll the task list and have them visible at the same time.

The columns that are displayed by default in the Web app contain the following information about the user tasks:
