## Context

In the SAP Task Center Web app, you can store customized filters in personalized views for an easier access to the targeted tasks. Additionally, you can store the sort order of the task list in a view.

> ### Example:  
> Here are a few example use cases for personalized views:
> 
> -   Store your tasks with *High* priority in a view.
> 
> -   Store your tasks in status *Open* in a view.



### Default View

The *Standard* view is the default view, initially available in the SAP Task Center Web app.

If you make changes to the filter options, which affect the standard view, the view is marked with an asterisk \(\*\) to indicate the unsaved changes, and you can save your personalized filter as a new view.

There can be only one default view, which you can change in the *Manage Views* dialog, or when saving a new view.

If you change the default view, you can open it from the dropdown list of views \(<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="color:#346187;"><span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span></span></span>\), or reload the current page.

## Create New View

You can create a personalized view, based on any of the options, displayed on the filter bar of the SAP Task Center Web app, including *Search* and *On Behalf Of* option. For more details on the *On Behalf Of* option, see [Working with the Task List](working-with-the-task-list-fe4a8b3.md).

1.  In your Web app, make the desired selection on filter tab, filter, search options, or sorting.

    The current view \(*Standard* is default\) is marked with an asterisk \(\*\) to indicate the unsaved changes.

2.  Open the dropdown, next to the name of the current view \(<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="color:#346187;"><span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span></span></span>\) and choose *Save As*.

3.  In the *Save View* window, add the name of your personalized view, choose if you want to make a default view, and save it.

## Open a View

1.  Open the dropdown, next to the name of the current view \(<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="color:#346187;"><span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span></span></span>\).

    In *My Views* you get the list of your views, including the default view and the views, marked as favorites by you.

2.  Choose a view from the list.

    When you select a view, it automatically loads your tasks in the Web app. In addition, the filter tab, from where the view was initially created, is selected.
