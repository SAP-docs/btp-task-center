# To-Dos in SAP Start

Process your most recent tasks from the *To-Dos* section in SAP Start.

In the *To-Dos* section of SAP Start, you can find your most recent tasks \(as received in your task list\), along with details of the task and action buttons. Processing a task from the card in SAP Start updates its status also in the SAP Task Center task list, and the respective task provider.
