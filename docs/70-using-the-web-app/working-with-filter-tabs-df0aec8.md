# Working with Filter Tabs

Filter tabs organize your tasks in prefiltered semantic groups for better efficiency.

## Prerequisites

Your administrator must have set up the filter tabs in the SAP Task Center Web app. For more information, see [Configure Filter Tabs in the SAP Task Center Web App](../40-administration/configure-filter-tabs-in-the-sap-task-center-web-app-53157da.md).

## Context

The filter tabs display tasks from different providers based on semantic categories, configured by your administrator. That way, you don't have to apply filters to see only your tasks from a given category; for example, your purchase-related tasks originating from different systems in your company. In addition, the filter tabs display the number of tasks from the semantic categories in your inbox.

## Filter Tabs

The filter tabs configured by your administrator are listed in alphabetical order. The default tab *All* is always in first position and contains all your tasks as they are fetched from the SAP Task Center task cache. The *Others* tab is always in the last position.

An additional *Failed Tasks* filter tab appears on second position only if there are tasks, failed during processing. You can choose the *Processing Errors* icon \(<span style="color:#346187;"><span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span></span>\) in the row of the task for more details. For more information, see [Working with Multiple Tasks](working-with-multiple-tasks-9f8ef8e.md).

Each semantic group is displayed with a different icon and name in filter tabs. These icons and names are displayed based on the configuration done by your administrator. For more information, see [Configure Filter Tabs in the SAP Task Center Web App](../40-administration/configure-filter-tabs-in-the-sap-task-center-web-app-53157da.md).

> ### Note:  
> Except for the *Others* tab, the names of the filter tabs are not translatable. For more information, see [Configure Filter Tabs in the SAP Task Center Web App](../40-administration/configure-filter-tabs-in-the-sap-task-center-web-app-53157da.md).

You can sort, filter, group, and search in filter tabs.

> ### Note:  
> The applied sorting, filtering, or search criteria in the *Task List* is not preserved when you switch between the filter tabs in the Web app.
