# Troubleshooting

When working with the SAP Task Center, you may encounter issues that prevent access or affect performance.

You can use the administration app to monitor or troubleshoot all configured destination connectors. For more information, see [Working with the Task Center Administration App](../40-administration/working-with-the-task-center-administration-app-3a1598c.md). If this doesn't help you identify the issue, contact SAP support.
